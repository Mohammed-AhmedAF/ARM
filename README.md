ARM Cortex-M projects

Simple ARM Cortex-M3/M4 projects and drivers made on TI Tiva-C and STM32F103

The included examples contain driver files only, no IDE-specific files are included. So for example, if you want to use the example in Keil IDE for example, you will have to create a new project and add the files of the example to the project.
